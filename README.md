# Python Developer Task: Data Storage, Algorithms, Polygon Collision, and File Operations

## Description
This Python project implements the following key features:

- **DataStorage Class:** A class to manage key-value data efficiently, supporting adding, retrieving, deleting, and listing data.
- **Top-K Frequent Words Algorithm:** A function to identify the most frequent words in a given text.
- **Polygon Collision Detection:** A function to check if two polygons intersect or if one contains the other.
- **File Processing:** A class that provides utilities to copy entire directories and process files with specific extensions (e.g., `.txt`, `.log`).
- **Logging:** The project includes logging functionality to track actions performed in the system, logged to `app.log`.
